## TODO:
- Connect Ruby to an SQLite database
- Create database, insert data into it
- Write code that maps a Ruby class to a database table
- Write code that inserts data regarding an instance of a class into a database table row
- Build methods that read from a database table
- Build a Giraffe.all class method that returns all giraffes from the database
- Build a Giraffe.find_by_name class method that accepts one argument, a name, searches the database for a giraffe with that name and returns the matching giraffe entry if one is found
- Convert what the database gives you into a Ruby object
- Update the database to correct for wrong information using Giraffe#update.
